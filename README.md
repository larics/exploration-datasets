# A Multi-Resolution Frontier-Based Planner for Autonomous 3D Exploration

Proposed multi-resolution frontier-based planner is a real-time capable exploration planner.
The planner consists of the algorithm for detecting frontier points, followed by clustering of frontier points and selecting the best
frontier point to be explored. Performance is achieved by not relying on data obtained directly 
from the 3D sensor, but on data obtained by a mapping algorithm. In order to cluster the frontier points,
the properties of the Octree environment representation are used, which allows easy analysis with
different resolutions.

This README provides instructions related to the downloading and use of our datasets. 
For more information about frontier-based planner installation and usage please refer to the [uav_frontier_exploration_3d](https://github.com/larics/uav_frontier_exploration_3d). 

If you want to visualize our generated OctoMap and verify the performace and efficiency of your exploration algorithms using our datasets, please refer to [wiki](https://github.com/larics/exploration-datasets/wiki).

Video recordings of frontier-based exploration for both simulation and experimental scenarios can be found at [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC0C6uwoEQ8a88D6cKfa81Hfo_s_qVZxf).
